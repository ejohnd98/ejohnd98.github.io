	 <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/" style="color: #000000">Ludum Dare</a> is a themed 48-hour game jam, where over the course of a weekend, a large group of people each create their own games from scratch. Recent ones have had entry numbers of over 2000.

     This is the first game I created. I was 13 at the time and did it in GameMaker (along with the rest of my Ludum Dare entries), which allows creation through 'drag and drop' elements, or by actual code. At the time, I believe I mainly used the former.
     
     In the game, you drove around a car, and stopped to pick up survivors (slightly different color which is hard to tell in gif). stopping while a zombie is close damaged the car. There was also an upgrade system that allowed better reverse/speed/turning/health. Overall, the game wasn't very good, and got progressively slower as you played it, but I was glad to complete any game at all, at the time.

     This game is a city builder type thing, where the goal was to get a certain amount of "research". To build the facility which created this, you had to meet some other conditions, such as a certain population or entertainment value. It wasn't very deep, but definitely a step up from previous things I'd done. This one was also done mainly with code, instead of 'drag and drop'. I'm still proud of this one, especially as I ranked #58 in the "fun" category, which was out of 1406 entries. These ratings are all done by the particiapants after the competition ends.
