                    The current project I've been working on since late 2021,
                    and easily the biggest so far. Originally started as a test
                    platformer controller I created after playing Symphony of
                    the Night. I was also just getting into creating music and
                    had started creating songs for an imaginary game, but
                    decided to make it real. Still a work in progress, but I aim
                    to finish before I graduate. I've uploaded a couple short video snapshots, one of which is linked below.

                    This game was created in 2020 for the UVic Game Dev Club's
                    72 hour game jam. The theme was just "Platformer" so I
                    created something in the vein of "A Short Hike." The gimmick
                    is that the player can walk up increasingly steep angles
                    with each item they collect. Although very linear and not
                    very polished, I was pretty happy with the outcome.

                    This Dungeon crawling project started mid 2019 and continued
                    on/off for a couple years. It started as an exercise so that
                    I could learn C++. I used SDL2 for rendering and input which
                    left a lot up to me to program myself, making progress on
                    the game part very slow, but fulfilling the original goal of
                    gaining experience in the language. I would still like to
                    complete a roguelike, but likely in an existing engine where
                    I can focus more on the game itself.

                    This Unity VR project was created in 2018 while I worked
                    with Victoria Makerspace and Ocean Networks Canada, whose
                    data we were showing off. The player is guided through
                    events of a Tsunami taking place in Port Alberni. We demoed
                    the app several times at events such as Discover Tectoria,
                    BCTECH Summit, VancouVR Fair, and up in Port Alberni itself.
                    This generated a bit of news which was very cool, one of
                    which is linked below:

                    Created in 2020 for Ludum Dare 47 "Stuck in a loop," this
                    was the first jam I'd done in years so it was nice to
                    finally complete something. Inspiration came from a lot of
                    pixely 3D horror games I'd seen a lot of on itch.io, so I
                    prioritized mood/atmosphere most of all.

                    Created for 2021's Ludum Dare 49 "Unstable." Definitely a
                    bit too ambitious with this game, but I managed to complete
                    something. At the time I was getting into a lot of David
                    Lynch's things and wanted to create a creepy endless driving
                    game. I also voiced the radio in-game which was a big time
                    commitment, plus I'm no voice actor, but I still think it's
                    neat.

                    This combo FPS and Cooking game was created for the 2020
                    "Mix and Game Jam." It's a little rough, but I still like
                    the concept. The theme was to combine multiple genres into
                    one, so I had the goal be to gather ingredients from enemies
                    to be used in cooking provided recipes.
