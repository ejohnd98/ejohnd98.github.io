                  Hi, my name is Eric. I'm a software engineer focused in the games industry with experience in Unity, Unreal Engine, and custom C++ engines.
	<br><br>
					I've been fortunate to work with some awesome people across several studios, and on this page I've showed, where possible, the projects I've worked on. I've included a variety of personal projects as well which generally come from my enjoyment of game jams.

		My contributions on this internal IP were through audio optimizations and a subsystem to handle queueing up dialogue + subtitles. We worked with an external company to setup sounds in Wwise but my work allowed us to iterate on dialogue audio ourselves while still going through the Wwise sound engine.

			Based off the original game's Android app, I worked on changing the UI to match the new themes and supporting the added localization features such as the language switching menu and Right-to-left languages. Part of this process required integrating with the Netflix Games SDK.

			My tasks on this involved fixing bugs and implementing UI features to match provided visual targets. The "Seasons" area was my main focus which provided a tree of things to unlock, updated periodically. In addition to C++ I learned and worked in the Bedrock Engine's custom UI scripting system.

		This dungeon crawler went through multiple complete reworks allowing me to iterate on the custom engine's core features like the Entity Component System, dungeon generation, movement, combat, input handling, level system, and animation/visual effects support.

		Most of the work for this arcadey game involved the movement patterns and enemy wave spawning. One of the core mechanics in bullet hell games is the patterns of bullets, so a chunk of development was spent on level design too. Check the linked page to see what others thought of it!

		Originally a test for a classic Castlevania style platformer, I expanded it into more of a complete game. While still incomplete, I developed the character physics/collision from scratch, along with systems for area loading, boss AI, stores, menus, and a variety of visual/audio effects. While less relevant, I also did a bunch of music for this which was a lot of fun.
