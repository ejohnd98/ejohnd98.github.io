Due to work/university I couldn't particpate in some of the more recent ones, but I've still managed to enter several times, some of which are shown below. The last few jams have had entry numbers of over 2000.

     This is the first game I created. I was 13 at the time and did it in GameMaker (along with the rest of my Ludum Dare entries), which allows creation through 'drag and drop' elements, or by actual code. At the time, I believe I mainly used the former. In the game, you drove around a car, and stopped to pick up survivors (slightly different color which is hard to tell in gif). stopping while a zombie is close damaged the car. There was also an upgrade system that allowed better reverse/speed/turning/health. Overall, the game wasn't very good, and got progressively slower as you played it, but I was glad to complete any game at all, at the time.

    This game is a city builder type thing, where the goal was to get a certain amount of "research". To build the facility which created this, you had to meet some other conditions, such as a certain population or entertainment value. It wasn't very deep, but definitely a step up from previous things I'd done. This one was also done mainly with code, instead of 'drag and drop'. I'm still proud of this one, especially as I ranked #58 in the "fun" category, which was out of 1406 entries. These ratings are all done by the particiapants after the competition ends, and as an incentive, rating other's games will make yours show up earlier in searches.

    The goal of this game was to eliminate all of the 'people' on the current level. this was done by placing blocks, such as water, lava and plants. It's a bit morbid, but at the time it seemed fitting given the theme. The gif is not actually one of these levels, but the sandbox mode where you can mess about freely.

    Unlike with GameMaker, there isn't anything I can really call a complete game. I mostly just tried to implement certain mechanics. Unfortunately due to version issues, accessing old projects requires a lot of work, but I did find one already compiled project, as seen to the left. It's somewhat similar to Asteroid, but with enemies and in 3D. Other things included plane physics, and Spiderman-like swinging (through a randomly generated city).
