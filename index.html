                  Hi, my name is Eric. I'm a software engineer focused in the games industry, with experience in Unity, Unreal Engine, and custom C++ engines.
	<br><br>
					I've been fortunate to work with some awesome people across several studios, and on this page I've tried to showcase, where possible, the projects I had the opportunity to work on. I've included a variety of personal projects as well, primarily from game jams and my involvement in UVic's GameDev Club.

						This app is a new version of Ellen DeGeneres' Heads Up game using Netflix properties. Originally based off the Unity project from the standard game's Android version, I primarily worked on changing the UI to match the new themes and supporting the added localization features like the language switching menu.

						This open world game demo is one of Gasket's own IPs. My work was focused on the UI and audio, with my primary contributions being audio optimizations and a subsystem to handle queueing up dialogue and displaying subtitles, specifically using Audiokinetic Wwise's external audio sources. We had previously worked with an external company to setup sounds in Wwise, but my work allowed us to iterate on the dialogue audio ourselves while still having it go through the Wwise sound engine.

						My tasks on this involved fixing bugs and implementing UI features to match provided visual targets. The "Seasons" area was my main focus which provided a tree of things to unlock, updated periodically. In addition to C++ I also worked in the Bedrock Engine's custom UI scripting system. Although it is no longer active, I'm glad I got a chance to contribute to it while it was.

My work included converting Open Street Maps data into in-game roads, populating them with vehicles, and overall game logic/controls. We demoed this at events too which led to some cool coverage.

						A doom-like project made for Ludum Dare 51. The theme was "10 seconds" which in this case meant you had to kill an enemy every 10 seconds or sacrifice a chunk of health. Development involved creating the character controller, level loading system, overall logic for the game, enemies, weapons, plus the art/sounds/music.

                    Originally started as a test for a classic Castlevania style platformer, I expanded it into more of a complete game. While still incomplete, I developed the character physics/collision from scratch, along with systems for area loading, boss AI, stores, menus, and a variety of visual/audio effects. While less relevant, I also did a bunch of music for this which was a lot of fun.

					This dungeon crawler went through multiple complete reworks allowing me to iterate on the custom engine's core features like the Entity Component System, dungeon generation, movement, combat, input handling, level system, and animation/visual effects support.

                    This game was inspired by a GDC talk from the developer of "A Short Hike." I wanted to create something in a similar vein which involved figuring out a triplanar shader for the terrain, a movement controller, a camera system for the varied directions the player goes, and the main gimmick which was the player's ability to walk up increasingly steep angles (even upside down) for each item they collected.

						This was my first jam in almost a decade so it was nice to get back into things. It followed a fairly simple loop of "go to this place on the map and interact with something" while avoiding the shadowy figure wandering around. Managed to achieve 8th place in the "mood" category however which I'm still proud of.

					This endless driving game featured a car radio in need of frequent retuning to catch directions for upcoming forks in the road. Work went into the car movement, and game logic, but primarily the endlessly generating road, which is pieced together over time from several varying road segments.
